    variables_node(m, 𝒩ˢᵗᵒʳ::Vector{<:AbstractElectrolyzer}, 𝒯, modeltype::EnergyModel)

Creates the following additional variables for **ALL** electrolyzer nodes:
- `:elect_on_b` - binary variable which is 1 if electrolyzer n is running in time step t.
- `:elect_previous_usage` - variable denoting number of previous operation
periods until time t in which the electrolyzer n has been switched on. The value is provided
in 1000 operational periods duration to avoid a too large matrix range.
- `:elect_usage_sp` - total time of electrolyzer usage in a strategic period.
- `:elect_usage_rp` - total time of electrolyzer usage in a representative period, only
declared if the `TimeStructure` includes `RepresentativePeriods`.
- `:elect_usage_mult_sp_b` - multiplier for resetting `:elect_previous_usage`
when stack replacement occured.
- `:elect_stack_replacement_sp_b` - binary variable, 1 if stack is replaced at the
first operational period of strategic period.
- `:elect_efficiency_penalty` - coefficient that accounts for drop in efficiency at
each operational period due to degradation in the electrolyzer. Starts at 1.
